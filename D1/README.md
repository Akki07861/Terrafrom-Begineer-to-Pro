Its my first time to create the instance with the terrform.
i have created the ec2.tf file for cretion of instance in aws 
make sure to add crediantilas to code.

for running this you need to setup the terraform in your pc/laptop and add security credentials in file.

Script to run:

terraform init                  #used to initialize the terraform in directory

terraform validate                      # used to validate the hcl code

terraform fmt                     # to formate the code into the ec2.tf 

terraform plan                # to make blueprint for architecture

terraform apply                # to apply the changes in the AWS

terraform destroy                      # to destroy the applied changes in AWs


note: you dont need to create the .tfstate and tfstate.backup file it is auto generated by terraform after terraform apply
